## What is Python ?
   * Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting and programming language.
   * It processes code at runtime using the interpreter.
   * One can interact with python interpreter directly via Python Interactive `>>>` or Python Console.
   * It is an cross platform language i.e. Supported by Windows XP to 10, Linux, MacOS etc.
   * Supports Object-Oriented programming style.

## Who created it ?
   * Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties

## Where can it be used ?
   * Day-to-day scripting tasks
   * Enterprise Automation
   * Distributed Systems
   * Software Architectures
   * Cloud Computing
   * Web Services
   * Text processing
   * Application development
   * Web development
   * Game development
   * DevOps Lifecycle
   * Scientific computing
   * Mathematics
   * Big Data Analytics
   * Media Processing
   * Machine Learning
   * Artifical Intelligence
    
## When should I use python ?
   * Proof of concepts implementations where "this works!" is important.
   * Quickly develop and deliver.
   * Leisure projects for fun
   * Experimenting stuff which is additional activity
   * There are too many unknowns, community comes to rescue

## Why should I use python ?
  * Free and open source
  * Python reads like English
  * Suitable for learning from Kids to Elderly People.
  * It's having a larger community, so more likely you'd get help if you ask questions
  * The more useful projects there are, the more likely someone has already built a function you need.
  * On Angel List, [Python](https://angel.co/skills) is amongst top demanded and the highest average salary offered skill.
  
## What Python is not?
   * Python is not compiled level language, Hence it is slow compared to C++ or C.
   * Python can't be used in the development of real time action and feedback systems.  
   * Hence, Operating systems like Windows, Linux does not use python for the developmwent but C, C++.
   * Its not hardware oriented language. You can't run python programs for controlling hardware without any interface.
   * Due to duck typing and dynamic typing (Google please), it leads to runtime errors.
   * It is an cross platform language i.e. Supported by Windows XP to 10, Linux, MacOS etc.
   * Supports Object-Oriented programming style.

### Terminology:
  * High Level: Any human whoc can read and understand english.
  * Interpreter: Translates one statement at a time rather than whole source code file. Hence, slower in execution.
  * Scripting: Work can be done by giving commands of platform like OS, DBMS.
