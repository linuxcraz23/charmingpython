## Who created it ?
   * Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties

## Where can it be used ?
   * Day-to-day scripting tasks
   * Text processing
   * Application development
   * Web development
   * Game development
   * DevOps Lifecycle
   * Scientific computing
   * Mathematics
   * Data Analytics
   * Media Processing
   * Video Games
   * Automation
    
## When should I use python ?
  * Proof of concepts implementations where "this works!" is important
  * Quickly develop and deliver
  * Performance is not a prime concern (for now)
  * Leisure projects for fun
  * Experimenting stuff which is additional activity
  * There are too many unknowns, community comes to rescue

## Why should I use python ?
  * Free and open source
  * Python reads like English
  * Python is really flexible. This means there are no hard rules on how to build features
  * The larger a community, the more likely you'd get help
  * The more useful projects there are, the more likely someone has already built a function you need
  * On Angel List, Python is the 2nd most demanded skill and also the skill with the highest average salary offered.

### Terminology:
  * High Level - Can understand by Human
  * Interpreter - Translates one statement at a time rather than whole source code file. Hence, faster in execution.
  * Scripting - Work can be done by giving commands of platform like OS, DBMS.
