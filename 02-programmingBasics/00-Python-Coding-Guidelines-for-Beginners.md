#### Easy to follow coding conventions for Beginners:

1. Always specify python version with which program has compiled.
2. Start program by writing purpose of it.
3. Write comments as many as you can to make code readable. Indicated by `#`.
4. Use 4 spaces rather than tabs while indenting code.
5. Keep two lines before conditional, looping, function, class statement.
6. Limit all lines to a maximum of 72 characters.
7. Imports should usually be on separate lines:
   ```python
   import os
   import sys
   ```
8. Follow inverted comma rule as follows:
   * Single - Character or word
   * Double - String with spaces
   * Triple - Multiline String
9.  Names to Avoid       
    Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
    
    In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero. When tempted to use 'l', use 'L' instead.
10. Keep spaces between operator and operands.
11. Always give meaningful names to var, fun, class and program itself.
